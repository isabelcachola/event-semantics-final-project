Below is a description of the folder included in this package:


Annotated-US2012-Election-Tweets: This folder has all the crowdsourced
annotations of the tweets pertaining to our project on the 2012 US Presidential
Elections. It has two subfolders corresponding to Questionnaire
1 and Questionnaire 2. Questionnaire 2 has two subfolders corresponding to the
two batches in which the annotations were done.  Each of these folders has two
files: 
	-- TaskPreview.pdf: An example questionnaire.  
	-- AnnotatedTweets.txt: The set of annotated tweets.

Questionnaire 1 was used to determine the presence of emotions in a tweet, the
style of the tweet, and the purpose of the tweet. It also had a question to
verify whether the tweet was truly relevant to US politics. 

The tweets that were marked as having one emotion were chosen for annotation by
Questionnaire 2. Here we asked various questions pertaining to emotional state
such as who is feeling the emotion (experiencer), what emotion (state), towards 
whom (stimulus), and more.

You can find the much larger set of un-annotated tweets pertaining to the 2012
US presidential elections here:
